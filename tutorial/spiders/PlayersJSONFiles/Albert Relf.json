        "After making a name with Norfolk, Albert Relf played first for Sussex, the county of his birth, in 1900, when in his 26th year, and he was one of the mainstays of his side twenty-one years later, when, at Horsham, he scored 153 against Leicestershire. After the War, owing to his coaching duties at Wellington, where he succeeded his father, he could not play regularly until the School holidays. In 1921 he came out second in the batting and first in the bowling averages; he took his benefit match and finished his county career.",

        "In his first season for Sussex, Relf shone chiefly as a batsman, but his bowling gradually improved and in 1903 he headed the county averages. His work created such an impression that he was picked for the first team which toured Australia under the auspices of the M.C.C. The very powerful side captained by P. F. Warner won the rubber and Relf in the first Test helped R. E. Foster in a ninth wicket stand of 115.",
        "On his return to England, Relf displayed his true form and from that time never looked back. He was very unfortunate in not being chosen more than once to play against Australia in England. On this occasion, at Lord's in 1909, he took five wickets for 85 runs in an innings of 350. In the ordinary course of events he would have been picked for England in the three subsequent matches, but S. F. Barnes stepped into the team at Leeds and another right-handed bowler of medium pace was not required. Relf went to South Africa in the winters of 1905 and 1913 and also appeared in Gentlemen and Players matches. ",
