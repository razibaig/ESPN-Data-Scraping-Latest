Hayward to add 135 for the last wicket and took seven wickets for 141 runs, and in 1900 at Scarborough. He also toured the West Indies with the M.C.C. team of 1910-11. He earned a match analysis of fifteen wickets for 154 runs against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in 1899, eight of them for 54 in the second innings, and on three other occasions dismissed ten or more men in a match. During the Indian summer of his career, he performed his only hat-trick, against Leicestershire at Leyton in 1907, his full analysis being four wickets for 6 runs.",
