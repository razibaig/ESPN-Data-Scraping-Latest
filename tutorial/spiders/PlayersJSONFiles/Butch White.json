        "\nThe majority of Butch White's 16-year career was spent with Hampshire and he was part of the side that won the Championship title for the first time in 1961. He formed a powerful new-ball combination alongside Derek Shackleton, who died less than a year ago, but after a decade of loyal service he was ignominiously discarded after an injury-blighted summer in 1971. He finished his playing days with one season at Glamorgan in 1972, but it's his exploits on the south coast that he'll be remembered for.  \n",
        "A broad-shouldered bowler with a long run-up, his best figures were 9 for 44 against Leicestershire in 1966 and he took over 100 wickets on four occasions. ",
