        "\nArthur Mold was one of the most controversial figures of an era when throwing became an increasing problem.  Although his action was considered suspect for many years, there was no doubting his speed, and that allied to the movement he got off the pitch, made him the foremast quick bowler of his generation.  At the time of his retirement he had taken more wickets than any other fast bowler. \n",
        "He made an immediate impact in his first season (1889) taking 100 wickets at 11.80, and in the next 12 summers he passed a hundred wickets on nine occasions, and two hundred twice (207 in 1894, 213 in 1895).",
