        "\nBob Berry honed his craft in the Lancashire Leagues before making his debut for his native county in 1948, and although the county was packed with spinners, he forged his way into the side with his slow left-armers.  Although he was not biggest turner of the ball, his variation in flight was exceptional, and in 1950 he earned himself a Test trial in which he took five wickets. As a result, he made his Test debut in the first Test against West Indies in 1950, taking 5 for 63 and 4 for 54 as England won their only match of the summer.  Retained for Lord's, he went wicketless as West Indies won their famous victory, but he bowled economically and was unfortunate to be dropped. He was included in the Ashes touring side that winter, but did not break into the Test side.  \n",
        "In 1953 he took all ten Worcestershire wickets in an innings (his figures were 10 for 102) but places at Lancashire were increasingly hard to come by and in 1955 he joined Worcestershire and enjoyed three of his most successful seasons.  Nevertheless, in 1958 he moved to Derbyshire, where he became the first person to be capped by three counties.",
        "In retirement he became a publican as well as maintaining strong links with the game. He was president of Farnsfield CC, where he lived, and also the Lancashire Players' Association.",
