        "\nDonald Carr was a schoolboy wonder, making his first-class debut in the Victory match against the Australian Services at Lord's in 1945. He was a talented allrounder - a no-nonsense batsman, slow left-arm bowler, and outstanding close fielder - and led Derbyshire with intelligence and good humour between 1955 and 1962.  Despite this, he played only twice for England, both games on the tour of India in 1951-52. In the Madras Test he captained England (in the absence of Nigel Howard) to their first defeat in India. \n",
