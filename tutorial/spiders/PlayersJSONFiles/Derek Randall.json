        "But there was more to Randall than his fielding. There was his\nspectacular, eccentric batting too. His Test record of 2,470 runs in 47\nmatches at an average of just over 33 betrays a lack of consistency, but\nwhen he was good, he was very, very good. There was his match-winning knock\nat Sydney in 1978-79 when, with England trailing after the first innings by 142\nruns, Randall held the second innings together with a magnificent 150. But\nthat was against an Australian side depleted by the Packer ban. On a\ndifferent plain altogether was his 174 in 1977 in the Centenary Test against\na strong Australia side at Melbourne. With England chasing an improbable 463\nto win, Randall took them unbelievably close - doffing his cap to the mighty\nDennis Lillee in the process after just evading a bouncer - but in the end\ntheir valiant chase fell 46 runs short.",
        "Randall, known as Arkle after the racehorse, was seldom far from the\ndrama. His lightning run-out of Rick McCosker in the Test when England\nclinched the Ashes at Headingley in 1977 amazed all who witnessed it. And in\nthe previous Test at his home ground of Trent Bridge he had been\nridiculously run out himself, stranded by Geoffrey Boycott at the other end.\nBoycott went on to make amends by hitting his 99th first-class century,\nfollowed by his 100th at Leeds in the next game. In the one-day game,\nRandall's fielding came even more to the fore and he became a one-day\nregular, playing in the World Cup Final defeat at the hands of the West\nIndies at Lord's in 1979.",
