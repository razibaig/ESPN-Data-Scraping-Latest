        "\nReg Simpson was a stylish opening bat for Nottinghamshire and England.\nHandsome, tall and dark, he cut an elegant figure at the wicket with his\nupright stance and flowing drives. A strong back-foot player, he hooked\nbetter than most tall men. He bowled occasional off-breaks, and was a fine\nfielder, especially in the covers. His first-class debut was delayed by the\nSecond World War, and he was first seen playing for Sind in India, where he\nwas stationed with the RAF. \n",
        "Simpson was 26 before he played first-class cricket in England, but he\nmade an immediate impression, and was selected to tour South Africa in\n1948-49. He played a single Test on that tour without passing double\nfigures, but when picked to play against New Zealand the following year he\nmade a century in the middle order. As an opener he found it hard to\ndisplace Hutton and Washbrook, and later faced competition from others and\nwas in and out of the Test side over the next six years. In 1951 he took\nover the captaincy of a weak Nottinghamshire, and shouldered the burden for the next decade. Intermittent back problems did not prevent him amassing sixty\nfour first-class centuries, and playing 27 Tests.",
