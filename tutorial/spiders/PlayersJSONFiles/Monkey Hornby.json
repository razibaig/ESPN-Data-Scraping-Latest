        "Hornby's Test career was undistinguished - just 21 runs in six innings. He had great difficulty against Spofforth, losing his wicket to him in both innings in his debut Test on the 1878-79 Australian tour, and again at the Oval in 1882 (when he captained the side that lost by seven runs). In his final Test in 1884 he managed to avoid Spofforth, but still made only 0 and 4.",
