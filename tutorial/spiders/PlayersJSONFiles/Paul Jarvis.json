        "\nPaul Jarvis showed immense potential as a young player. The youngest-ever\ncricketer to represent Yorkshire in the County Championship (aged 16 and two\nmonths) in 1981, he never reached the heights his talents promised. Relentlessly injury-prone, he was also a victim of some of the most fickle selectorial whimsy. Jarvis became the youngest player to take hat-tricks in the Sunday league (1982) and the Championship (1985), and was viewed as Yorkshire's cutting edge while still a teenager. Relatively short for a quick bowler (5'10\"), he generated good pace from a short, fast run up, and an athletic leap with a very quick arm action. He suffered from injury in both 1984 and 1985, slowing his progress, probably as a consequence of over-bowling at such a young age, but won his county cap in 1986 following match figures of 11 for 92 against Middlesex. \n",
        "The following year, 1987, he took 81 wickets (his best-ever tally) and played a key role in the Benson and Hedges Cup winning team, with 4 for 43 in the final against Northants. It was enough to secure a place on the winter tour of Pakistan, New Zealand and Australia.",
        "Jarvis made his Test debut in 1988 against New Zealand at Christchurch,\nbowling fast on slow pitches, and taking six wickets in the first two games. He was then dropped for the final Test. Recalled for the 1988 home series against the mighty West Indies, Jarvis bowled well in the first two Tests, taking 4 for 107 and scoring 29* at Lord's, both Test bests. A back strain ruled him out of the team for the rest of the series, just as it seemed he could form an effective new-ball partnership with Graham Dilley. It was a year before he was to play again, at Lord's against Australia. Three times in a row he beat the outside edge of Steve Waugh, but the Australian survived to score an unbeaten 152* as all the bowlers suffered. Jarvis couldn't take a wicket in the following Test at Edgbaston and was again dropped.",
        "He was banned from Test cricket for three years after accepting an offer to\njoin a rebel tour of South Africa (1989-90), but was selected to tour India\nand Sri Lanka in 1992-93, when the ban was lifted early. He bowled well on\nunhelpful pitches, and entirely without fortune, taking four wickets in the\nfirst two Tests as England were trounced. He performed well in the one-day\nseries too, winning the Man-of-the-Match award for 5 for 35 against India in\nBangalore. Despite being generally regarded as England's best bowler, he was\ndropped for Phil DeFreitas (who didn't take a wicket all tour) for the final\nTest. His last Test came against Sri Lanka in Colombo, where he took 3 for 76\nin the first innings.",
