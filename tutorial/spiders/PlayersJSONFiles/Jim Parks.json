        "\nJim Parks was a multitalented cricketer, initially as a batsman and in latter years as an outstanding batsman-wicketkeeper.  His father, also Jim, had been a Sussex stalwart between the wars and had played once for England, but young Jim soon established himself in his own right. \n",
        "He made his debut in 1949 as a batsman who could also bowl decent offspin and was also an outstanding fielder. His Test debut in 1954 was as a specialist batsman but it was only when he took up wicketkeeping that his international career took off. That he did so was through necessity as Sussex were in need of a keeper and Parks volunteered; he was a natural. Within 18 months he had been recalled by England and he remained a mainstay of the side for much of the 1960s. ",
        "Parks captained Sussex in 1967 and 1968, making the third of his four Lord's final appearances in the second season, and at the end of 1972 he left Hove and joined Somerset on a three-year contract.",
