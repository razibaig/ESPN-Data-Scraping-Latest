        "Small and stout, Hemmings was a unlikely looking professional cricketer but he made up for that with wily offspin and durable lower-order batting. He was a slightly surprising choice for the 1982-83 Ashes tour, and his 95 as nightwatchman at Sydney was coupled with six wickets in the game.",
        "He returned on the infamous tour of Pakistan in 1987-88, and thereafter his England career seemed over until John Emburey's three-year ban for touring South Africa brought Hemmings back into the mix.  His Test career ended in Australia in 1990-91, but he carried on in first-class cricket until he was 46. ",
