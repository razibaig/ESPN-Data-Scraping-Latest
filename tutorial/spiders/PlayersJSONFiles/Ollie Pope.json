        "\nOllie Pope, a wicketkeeper full of batting invention, made great strides for Surrey in 2017 in all three formats. It was his trickery as a Twenty20 batsman that most won most admirers, but there was also a maiden Championship century. That hundred came in only his third Championship appearance, against Hampshire at the Ageas Bowl, and was full of energetic cuts and pulls as he ended Hampshire's hopes of a last-day victory, the innings culminating in slightly hollow circumstances with an over from the part-time bowling of James Vince, the England batsman, as Hampshire gloomily awaited the draw. \n",
        "His Championship debut also made him part of a historic moment when Surrey fielded four teenagers against Middlesex at The Oval, the first time that had happened in a Championship match since World War 2.",
