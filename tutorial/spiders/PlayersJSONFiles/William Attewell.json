        "\nA cricketer of considerable accomplishments, William Attewell (known\nas Dick to his team-mates) was best known as a bowler of unremitting\naccuracy and length. He\nbowled at medium pace, varying pace, flight and spin cleverly, and\nrarely bowled a loose ball. He used his abilities to perfect \"off\ntheory\", popular in the 1890s, where he frustrated the batsman by\nbowling wide of the off stump to a packed off-side field. He was a\nfine fielder in the covers, and a more than useful batsman with a\nfirst-class century to his name (and a double hundred for MCC v\nNorthumberland). A Nottinghamshire man, he came into the county side\nin 1881, and rarely left it until his retirement nineteen years\nlater. He took 100 wickets in a season ten times, and toured Australia\nthree times, most successfully in 1887-8. \n",
        "After retirement he became a first-class umpire, and later the\nprofessional at Shrewsbury School, where a young Neville Cardus was\nhis assistant. His brother Thomas also played briefly for\nNottinghamshire (DL, 2000)."
