        "\nWhen Stewart was in full flow, there were few who could live with him. Relying\non touch, he was in his element against the quicks, cover-driving with a neat\nflourish and pulling with panache - most memorably when he thundered two\ncenturies during England's storming of fortress Bridgetown in 1993-94. He was\nless secure against the spinners, however, and his instinctive style meant\nhis career was a sequence of purple patches and less colourful troughs. \n",
        "Stewart's strength as an opening batsman was compromised by the\nselectors' desire for balance: he and Jack Russell swapped the\nwicketkeeping gloves regularly throughout the 1990s, but Stewart, better\nstanding back than standing up, eventually became the regular No. 1. He took\nover the England captaincy from Mike Atherton in 1998 and promptly led the\nside to its first major series win for 12 years, against South Africa. But\nStewart's leadership was based on passion not nous, and when England lost\nanother Ashes series and flopped in the 1999 World Cup, he was harshly axed.",
        "He hit top form again during the 2000 one-day triangular series, and when he\nscorched a century in his 100th Test, the sheer length of the standing\novation he received suggested that Stewart had become a national\ninstitution. But his squeaky-clean image took a blow during England's\n2000-01 tour of Pakistan when an Indian bookmaker alleged that Stewart had\naccepted money for information during England's trip to India in 1992-93.\nStewart survived, though.",
        "Against India at Lord's in 2002, he crowned his achievements by becoming England's most-capped Test cricketer, overtaking Graham Gooch's record of 118 matches. Despite calls for a younger wicketkeeper to take his place, Stewart continued to give his all for England until he called it a day from all forms of the game after England's drawn series with South Africa in 2003. Fittingly, his final game was at The Oval in which he scored 38, but more importantly to a man like Stewart, England won. His love of the football manager-style soundbite has earned him the nickname Gaffer. ",
