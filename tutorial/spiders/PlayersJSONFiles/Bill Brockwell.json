        "\nBrockwell, William, a prominent Surrey cricketer nearly fifty years ago, died on July 1. A stylish and often brilliant batsman, strong in back play and a free hitter in front of the wicket, Brockwell also was a useful fast medium paced bowler and a smart fieldsman, notably at second slip where he succeeded George Lohmann--one of the surest catches ever seen in that position. First playing for the county in 1886, Brockwell matured slowly but it was difficult to find a place in the very powerful Surrey eleven of that period. However, from 1891 to 1902 he was a regular member of the side and played his last game in 1903 when the team were declining rapidly in all round strength. \n",
        "During Brockwell's career at the Oval Surrey carried off the Championship eight times and once tied for first place with Lancashire and Nottinghamshire. Needless to say Surrey were tremendously strong in those days. Brockwell played under John Shuter, K. J. Key, D. L. A. Jephson and the present president, H. D. G. Leveson Gower. Among his contemporaries were such great batsmen as W. W. Read, Maurice Read, Robert Abel, Tom Hayward and bowlers of equal fame--George Lohmann, Tom Richardson and William Lockwood. To be in such company was an honour; and in 1894 Brockwell came out at the head of the English batting with the highest aggregate, 1491 and best average 38.9. He was also leading scorer for Surrey with 1091 runs and an average of 35--remarkable figures in a summer of` unsettled weather.",
