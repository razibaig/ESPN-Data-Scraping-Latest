        "\nIt remains to be seen whether Simon Kerrigan is forever remembered for his traumatic Test debut, against Australia at The Oval in 2013, or if he is able to force his way back for a substantial international career. Given a surprise cap after the Ashes had been sown up, Kerrigan's method entirely departed him and he was plundered for 53 off eight overs as Shane Watson tore into a succession of full tosses and long hops.  \n",
        "That appearance was an unfair reflection on Kerrigan, who was widely regarded as the next spinner in line for England honours. He made his first significant mark during the 2010 season when he took 30 wickets in 13 Championship matches, having earned his chance when Gary Keedy suffered a broken collarbone in pre-season. When Keedy was fit they formed a potent duo although when only one spinner was selected Kerrigan still had to bide his time.",
        "Their ability to work in harness was shown again early in the 2011 season when they impressed on a crumbling surface at Edgbaston were Kerrigan took 5 for 7. That, though, paled by comparison with what he managed in the penultimate game of Lancashire's successful Championship season as he took 9 for 51 against Hampshire, claiming the crucial final wicket with four minutes left. Peter Moores, a Lancashire coach who would soon leave for a second stint with England, called that display \"world class\". On that September afternoon rain fell everywhere except Aigburth and Roy Tattersall, a Lancashire and England spinner of the 1950s, beamed with pleasure amid serious illness.",
        "Kerrigan gained international recognition with one-day appearances for England Lions and displaced the veteran Keedy as Lancashire's first choice spinner for 2012, when he took 44 Championship wickets at 34.81 and a six-wicket haul for England Lions in a first-class match against Australia A at Old Trafford in August. Keedy's move to Surrey paved the way for Kerrigan to become Lancashire's No. 1 spinner, but after that disturbing Test debut he returned to county cricket with a sizeable task to rebuild rhythm and self-belief.",
        "There were signs of recovery in 2016 when he bowled nearly 500 Championship overs, but in a summer where spinners had a comparatively high number of turning tracks after a change to toss regulations his wickets cost 38 apiece. He did take his first five-wicket haul since that Hampshire performance in 2011, however, the same county suffering once more as he bowled out the tail in a Lancashire innings victory. Opportunities were few and far between, however, in 2017 as Lancashire preferred his fellow left-arm spinner Stephen Parry and he was loaned out to Northants in an attempt to reinvigorate his career.",
