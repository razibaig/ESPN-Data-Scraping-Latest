        "Was Test  selection once such an\nautocratic, uncomplicated business\nas this? In 1935 Norman 'Mandy'\nMitchell-Innes, a name barely\nheard of, was chosen to play for his\ncountry against South Africa on the\nauthoritative word of Plum Warner,\nwho had just seen him make a\nhundred for Oxford University off\nthe tourists' attack.",
        "Mandy was clearly a prospect.\nHe had captained and excelled for\nSedbergh. He had made an unlikely\ndebut for Somerset at the age of 16.\nThere were to be four blues and a\nrecord-breaking aggregate of runs\n(3,319) for the university. The batting\nstyle was brisk, orthodox and good\nto the eye.",
        "After the Oxford innings of\n168, full of precocious fours and a\ncomplete lack of inhibition against\nSouth Africa, Warner went to see\nhim at the close of play. \"I think\nyou'd better come and play for us\nin the first Test at Trent Bridge\"\n- as perfunctory as that. If it was\nan intuitive hunch, it came from\na respected figure who apparently\nfavoured the concept of one-man\ncommittees.",
        "Mitchell-Innes was in his\nsecond year at Oxford, reading law.\nHis family may have wondered\nwhether he was spending a slightly\ndisproportionate amount of time\nat sport; his golf (another blue and\nalready a 295-yard hole-in-one at\nMinehead) was as promising as his\ncricket. The invitation from Plum\ntook him completely by surprise.\n\"We'd keep you in for the second\nTest at Lord's, you know.\"",
        "The young batsman stammered his thanks. It rained at Nottingham\nand he made only 5 in his one\ninnings. But he found himself\nstanding alongside Wally Hammond\nin the slips and then moved forward\nto short leg for Hedley Verity. The\ncaptain, Bob Wyatt, discreetly\nwhispered that he might be\nstanding a little too close to the bat\nfor comfort.",
        "When it came to the next Test,\nMandy was suffering from one of\nhis chronic attacks of hay fever.\nHe contacted Warner and said he\nfelt he should stand down, lest he\nstarted sneezing and dropped a\ncatch. There was much deliberation\nbefore it was agreed. Errol Holmes\ntook his place. Now comes the irony:\nMandy was staying with Holmes\nfor the weekend of the match and,\nhaving decided he was fit enough to\nplay for Oxford University against\nSurrey, was dropped off on the way\nto The Oval. Amid the sneezes he\nhit a perky, unbeaten 132. It was a\nstatistic seized on mischievously by\none or two of the newspapers.",
        "The Test invitation did not\ncome again. There was one tour for\nhim in 1935-36 to Australia and\nNew Zealand. But his unselfish\ngesture, in that perhaps na\u00efve plea\nto Warner, may have determined\nthe course of his cricket career.\nWhen he died on December 28, he\nwas England's oldest surviving Test\nplayer at the age of 92. He remained\na good- natured and unassuming\nman, refreshingly free from\ncynicism or regrets. He remembered\ninstead the joy of playing at The\nParks, ever windy, \"with Hammond\ntaking the new ball against us and Phil Mead stuffing newspapers\ninside his flannels to keep warm\".",
        "His father had retired to\nMinehead, so Mandy was qualified\nto play for Somerset. This he did for\nthe first time when summoned by a\ntelegram from the former Somerset\ncaptain and then secretary John\nDaniell to take the night train from\nScotland - where he had just been\nknocked out of a golf tournament -\nand play for the county next day. He\nhad only 69 matches for Somerset\nbecause of a career in the Sudan\nPolitical Service but was always a\npopular inclusion when on leave,\neven though he walked to the crease\nusually without a net.",
        "The pros did not resent a place\nbeing found for him. In 1948, as Somerset searched for an amateur\ncaptain, he was one of several who\ndid the job in quaint rotation. He\ntook over for April and May, though\nin truth points were minimal.\nWhen he returned permanently\nfrom the Sudan, he was asked if he\nwould consider becoming secretary\nand captain but the terms must have\nbeen too modest. For 25 years he was\ncompany secretary to a Sunderlandbased\nbrewery.",
