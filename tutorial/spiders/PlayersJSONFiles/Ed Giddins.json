        "At his best he generated sharp pace from a muscular action and, on helpful wickets, presented significant challenges for a batsman. He played one Test in 1999, and, in his second, the following summer, claimed 5-15 in the first innings and won the match award against Zimbabwe at Lord's.",
        "Two unproductive Tests later he was dropped: on the flat wickets usually encountered in Test cricket, Giddins struggled for penetration (although his bowling average remained impressively low).",
        "He had joined Warwickshire in 1998 after the drugs scandal cost him his job at Sussex and earned him an 18-month ban (Giddins raised money while serving his drugs ban by setting up a business selling Christmas trees with his team-mate Nadeem Shahid)  but his form fell away after England ditched him in 2000, and he moved to Surrey, and then Hampshire, until his early retirement during the 2003 season.",
