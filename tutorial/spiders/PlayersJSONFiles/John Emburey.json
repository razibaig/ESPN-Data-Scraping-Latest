        "\nIn the era before Shane Warne when spin bowling was on its uppers,  John Emburey was perhaps the best offspinner in the world, which did  not say much. He was tall with a classically looping action, and capable  of getting huge amounts of bounce and away-drift. But his qualities were  submerged amid the grim battles slow bowlers faced in the 1980s:  uncongenial pitches and one-day cricket, which forced him to become  primarily negative and defensive. He improvised more in his batting, in  which he managed to score runs while infuriating bowlers by ignoring  both footwork and backlift. Always a willing talker and theorist, he was an excellent senior pro and a promising coach (though he was fired by  Northamptonshire before returning home to Middlesex). Over-promoted  to England captain for two Tests amid general chaos in 1988, he was fired  as capriciously as he was appointed. Emburey was the only cricketer to  go on both (1981-82 and 1989-90) England rebel tours to South Africa,  and was instantly forgiven both times, which says much about attitudes  at Lord's but something about the general esteem for his qualities. \n",
