        "\nYorkshire's oldest capped player\nAlec Coxon died peacefully four\ndays after his 90th birthday, some\nfour decades after his turbulent\ncareer had ended and less than\n24 hours after he had emptied\nhis glass and bade farewell to his\nfriends. So, contrary to myth, he\nwas not indestructible. \n",
        "Tall, lean and decidedly mean,\nhe was a splendid fast-medium\nbowler, as well as a dogged,\njourneyman batsman and reliable\nfielder, mostly at slip, and many\nsound judges thought he was worth\nmore than his solitary Test against\nthe Australians at Lord's in 1948.\nHe may well have been given\na second chance had umpire\nClaud Woolley agreed that he had\ntrapped Don Bradman plumb lbw\non the back foot with an inswinger\nbefore he had scored. Alec had\nalready snared Sidney Barnes,\ncaught by Len Hutton for a duck,\nand was convinced the greatest\nscalp of all was his.",
        "But it was not to be and he\nended with match figures of 3 for\n172 off 63 economical overs and\nhe was not selected again. That\nsole cap made him the third oldest\nsurviving England player after\nSomerset's Norman Mitchell-Innes,\nwho is 91, and Dennis Brookes, of\nNorthamptonshire, who was 90 in\nOctober.",
        "Perhaps his irascible nature\nweighed against him, though\nhe was keen to puncture one of\ncricket's more enduring legends\n- that he once punched Denis\nCompton. \"It simply didn't\nhappen,\" he said. \"The truth is\nthat we had a difference of opinion\nand exchanged a few heated words\nduring a drinks break on the field\nin a festival game. Denis was a very\ngood batsman who made up his\nown shots but I can't say I liked\nhim. He had fancy ideas about his\nown importance. He needed to\nkeep his feet on the ground and I\nbelieve now what I told him that\nday, that he'd have been all right if\nhe'd been born a Yorkshireman.",
        "There has also lingered lively\nspeculation about why he abruptly\nleft Yorkshire at the end of 1950\nafter enjoying his best season\nwith 131 wickets at an average of\n18.60, but he always indignantly\ndenied the committee sacked him.\nThe reason, he always insisted,\nwas because he was passed over for\nthe MCC party to tour Australia that\nwinter. Disillusioned, he accepted\nan offer to play for Sunderland as\nthe first \u00a31,000-a-year professional\nin the Durham Senior League.",
        "Alexander Coxon - known\nwidely as Alec - was born in\nHuddersfield in 1916, one of\n11 children. After stints as a\nprofessional in the Bradford League\nwith Brighouse and Saltaire (as\nwell as being a versatile defender\nfor the former football league side\nBradford Park Avenue), he went\nstraight into the Yorkshire side\nat the age of 29 when first-class\ncricket recommenced after the\nSecond World War. While his hostility and bluntness upset many, he was also hugely\nsociable with a lively sense of humour that won many friends; he was a human chameleon capable of warmth and wrath, rudeness and charm, generosity and\noutrageousness. Stories inevitably abounded about such a larger-than-life character, some distorted, some fiction but many true, one of which now belongs to cricket's folklore. It happened during a Minor Counties match at a rain-sodden Old Trafford when the Lancashire Seconds batsman Roy Collins was hitting a century off Durham\nbowlers, Coxon included, who were having difficulty keeping their feet. Sawdust was called for and, when an inexperienced ground boy arrived with a sack full and asked\nwhere to put it, Alec pointed and ordered: \"Right there.\" The lad did as he was told - and deposited the lot in front of the stumps right on a good length.",
        "The match had to be halted and the players returned to the pavilion while groundstaff shovelled and swept it away. One Durham player Ken Land remembered gleefully\nyears later: \"It was more like a butcher's shop than a cricket pitch. We thought it was hilarious and even the umpires were chuckling.\"  But one man did not see the funny\nside; the captain RB `Bill' Proud, a huge man and strict disciplinarian known as the `Durham Ox' - and Alec never played for the county again.",
