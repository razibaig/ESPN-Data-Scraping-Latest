        "To describe Derek Underwood as a slow bowler, or simply a spinner is to give\na false picture of a unique performer. Much of his bowling was delivered at\na respectable medium pace, and  always off a plodding run-up of ten yards or\nso. When conditions were right he would turn the ball extravagantly, but on\ngood  pitches, against good players, he would still take plentiful wickets\nthrough his unfailing accuracy. Batsmen, infuriated or entranced by the\nunhittable length and line firing at them with the remorseless regularity of\na  bowling machine, would very often commit cricketing suicide in their\nfrustration.",
        "Underwood was at his most effective on the uncovered English pitches  of\nthe sixties and early seventies. On a \"sticky dog\" the cricket slang for a\npich affected by rain he could be unplayable. Full covering failed to thwart\nhim, however, and both in county and Test cricket he maintained a high\nsuccess rate through his dedicated attention to detail. A bad delivery from\nUnderwood was a rarity and the anguish over it would be etched on his\nexpression. Although sometimes accused of bowling, a negative, flat\ntrajectory, when conditions demanded something  more flighted, Underwood\nwas a master of variations of pace and slight shifts in angle. He won\ncountless lbw victims with the ball which swung in to the right hander,\n\"with the arm\".",
        "Underwood's most memorable triumph of many in his long  career, was to\nretrieve the series against Australia. It had seemed hopelessly lost. The\ncircumstances of the story are extraordinary and the fact that they could\nnot be repeated now makes it a tale worth retelling.",
