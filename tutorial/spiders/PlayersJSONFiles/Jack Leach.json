        "\nJack Leach was the unexpected star of the 2016 County Championship. Thrust to prominence by Somerset's decision to gamble on turning wickets at Taunton, and put relegation fears to bed, his left-arm spin proved so destructive that they entered the last day of the Championship season on top of the table and hoping that they might win a first-ever title. It was not to be, as Middlesex pipped them, leaving Leach to reflect on a mighty season in which he took 65 wickets at 21 apiece. A slight figure with a high bowling action, thin of hair and tidy of beard, he bowled in spectacles, a rare thing in 2016, giving him the air of a slightly apologetic junior accountant. \n",
        "Many presented Leach as an attractive pick for England's Test tours of Bangladesh and the Caribbean, but after his season's best figures of 6-42 had set up the defeat of the defending champions, Yorkshire, at Headingley, Somerset's captain Chris Rogers warned of the need for caution. \"I am still a big believer that you need more than one good season to play for England,\" Rogers said. \"With Jack, I think his game's in order, I think emotionally he still has a bit of a way to go.  He is still a young guy, he has only ever been in Somerset and the challenges in international cricket are a lot more difficult. If they pick him then good luck to him but they'd better look after him.\"",
        "The debate was then stilled when routine tests on his action at Loughborough revealed a kink early in his action that meant he exceeded the 15 degree limit on the straightening of his arm. Remedial work took time. He was ineffective on an England Lions trip to Sri Lanka and began the county season tentatively. Six wickets against Warwickshire - although he did not feel he bowled well - gave him heart, match figures of 9 for 141 against Lancashire at Taunton saw a true return to form and in the final match of the season, in partnership with the young offspinner Dom Bess, he bowled excellently on another Taunton turner to keep Somerset up and send Middlesex down in their place. He lost an Ashes place on a split vote, but he had turned his year. ",
        "Leach was born in Taunton and first taken to Taunton to watch Somerset when he was a few days old. He told his father as a youngster that he wanted to be a fast bowler, but his father demurred. So it was that he developed through the Somerset youth system as a spinner. He played in the same U-13, U-15 and U-17 sides as Jos Buttler, also gaining England U-15 honours, but while Buttler was always destined for stardom, Leach was obliged to take a job parking trolleys at a branch of Sainsbury's supermarket in Taunton. He helped Dorset to victory in the 2010 Minor Counties Championship - he claimed 6-21 in Lincolnshire's second innings - and then played for Cardiff MCCU in 2011 and 2012. His first-class debut actually came for the MCCU against Somerset in April 2012: Leach delivered 41 wicketless overs as Somerset amassed 642 for 3.",
        "Later that season he made his Somerset first-team debut in a two-day match against South Africa and bowled Hashim Amla. He subsequently made his Championship debut in Liverpool and performed respectably - he claimed 3-37 from 18 overs in the second innings - but with Somerset already having another left-arm spinner, the highly-rated George Dockrell, on the staff and then signing Pakistan's Abdur Rehman for the latter part of the season, opportunities were limited. ",
        "After spending the winter playing club cricket in Brisbane - he helped his side win the local T20 competition - he started the 2013 season in the Championship side due to an injury to Dockrell. He claimed 5-63 against Warwickshire but, despite heading the club's bowling averages that season, again struggled for opportunities as Somerset signed another spinner - Piyush Chawla - as an overseas player towards the end of the season.",
