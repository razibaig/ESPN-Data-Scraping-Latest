        "\nA reliable and hard-working fast-medium bowler, and unusually for an English seamer, as effective overseas as at home. With his height (he was 6' 4\") he was able to make the ball bounce, move off a length, and was quick enough to hurry good batsmen on hard wickets. Brown's determination, which enabled him to recover from injury, made him popular with the public and selectors alike, and that quality was reflected in his role as a dogged tail-ender.  He captained Warwickshire from 1975 to 1977, and was vice-captain of the MCC team that toured Pakistan in 1966-67. \n",
