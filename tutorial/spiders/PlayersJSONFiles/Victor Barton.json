        "\nAn attacking middle order batsman whose career was curtailed by\nill-health - he was only 39 when he died - Victor Barton played in\njust a single Test. An Army man, he first played for Kent, producing a\nvital innings in the thrilling Kent victory over Nottinghamshire that\nproduced a three-way Kent-Nottinghamshire-Lancashire tie for the\nChampionship in 1889. But Barton failed to establish himself in the Kent\nside,\nand then like so many military men, played for Hampshire for a further\n11 years. A powerful driver, he hit the ball so hard on the on-side that\nWisden's obituary relates that \"fieldsmen who stood at mid-on had a\nwholesome dread of him\".  Barton played his one Test in 1892, a season\nin which England had two simultaneous touring teams, the other side\nbeing in Australia. He was also a useful bowler, taking 141\nfirst-class wickets (DL, 2000). \n"
