        "\nDavid Lloyd was an unlucky cricketer. Many of his admirers - and probably he himself - were disappointed that he did not achieve more. A talented allrounder, and especially a brilliant strokemaker, he was very much, and proudly, a man of what Neville Cardus called the Lancashire hinterland (Accrington). He promised to - and almost did - reach the top; but remained calmly cheerful and humorous despite his setbacks. In short, in his Second Test- against India in 1974- he scored a splendidly fluent 214 not out.  \n",
        "That alone ensured his selection for the following winter's tour of Australia where, in a side routed by the `heart-line' attack of Lillee and Thomson, he was effectively shocked and shattered out of Test cricket.",
        "Like several other capable and loyal professionals of his period, he took on the captaincy of his county - which he had never sought - out of loyalty. In a term of office from 1973 to 1977 he led the county to three Gillette finals, one of which they won. ",
        "As a captain, his natural modesty probably caused him to use his left-arm slow bowling much less than he might have done. For many years he was one of the bravest and finest close fieldsmen in the world.",
