        "\nBorn in Torquay in 1946, Roger Tolchard made his Leicestershire debut in\n1965, winning his county cap just a year later. A middle-order batsman and\nwicketkeeper, he toured India and Pakistan with the MCC in 1972-73,\nperforming well. A good keeper, he was unfortunate to be a contemporary of\nAlan Knott and Bob Taylor. His first-class career batting average (31.13) was actually better than Knott's, and there was a suspicion that he could have become a Test-class batsman had he been unfettered by wicketkeeping responsibilities. \n",
        "Tolchard never kept wicket for England in a Test, winning selection instead as a specialist batsman while on tour in India in 1976-77. He made a defiant, five-and-a-half-hour, 67 in his debut innings and with Tony Greig and put on\n142 crucial runs to help England to victory for the first time in a Test in\nCalcutta. He played in all four Tests in the series, fielding brilliantly,\nbut having little further fortune with the bat. He received what Henry\nBlofeld described as \"the worst decision he ever saw,\" when dismissed lbw by\nChandrasekhar at Bangalore. Good enough to win selection on the following\nyear's Ashes tour (1978-79) he was close to winning further Test recognition\nwhen a bouncer fractured his cheek bone and forced him back to England.",
