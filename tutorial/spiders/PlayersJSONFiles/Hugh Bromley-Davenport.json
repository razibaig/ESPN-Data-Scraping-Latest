        "Going up to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, he gained a Blue in 1892 and 1893 under the captaincy of F. S. Jackson. In the second meeting with Oxford he obtained a match record of five wickets for l l runs. An incident in that game led to a change in the Laws. Convinced that Oxford intended to throw away their last wicket, which, as they were 84 behind, would have meant that they would be compelled to follow-on and thus leave Cambridge to take last innings on a deteriorating pitch, C. M. Wells frustrated any such attempt by bowling two wides to the boundary. In the end Cambridge won by 266 runs, and the following year the follow-on became compulsory only if a side finished the first innings 120 or more behind their opponents' total.",
