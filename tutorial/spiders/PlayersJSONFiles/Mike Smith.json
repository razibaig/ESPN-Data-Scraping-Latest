        "\nA left-arm bowler, Mike Smith was arguably the foremost exponent of swing\nbowling in county cricket in the 1990s. Yorkshire-born, but unwanted by his home county, Smith made his Gloucestershire debut in 1991, having previously represented the Combined Universities. Of slight physique, possessing neither great pace, nor the height at 5' 9\" to create awkward lift, he relied heavily on\nmovement in the air to trouble batsmen. \n",
        "He was selected for the England A tour of Pakistan (1995-96), but a rib injury forced him home after he'd bowled just 22 overs. The following summer he took 60 more wickets. He made his Test debut against Australia in 1997 - in his third\nover on an unhelpful Headingley pitch he found the edge of Matthew Elliott's bat, but Graham Thorpe at first slip put down the relatively simple chance. Elliott, 29 at the time, went on to score 199 as Australia won by an innings to take a series lead, and Smith was unable to take a wicket in 23 overs. His case wasn't helped as he batted with timidity against an irrepressible Gillespie. He later confessed that it was the only occasion all summer that he had been unable to swing the ball.  His chance had gone.",
