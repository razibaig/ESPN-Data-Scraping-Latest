        "\nFuture generations, accustomed\nto players pocketing a gold watch\nand parchment scroll after three\nyears' loyal service to the same\ncounty cricket company, may not\nknow what to make of Dennis\nBrookes. The quietly spoken,\nunostentatious Yorkshireman\njoined Northamptonshire as a\nteenager in 1933 and remained\nclosely associated with the club\nfor the rest of his long life. A\nspecial dinner to mark the 70th\nanniversary of his first trial\nmatch packed out Northampton's\nnew Indoor School in July 2002,\nthe guests passing through the\nAbington Avenue gates that bear\nhis name. \n",
        "Between 1934 - when Hedley\nVerity trapped him for a single\n\"playing back when I should\nhave been forward\" on his\nChampionship debut at Bradford\n- and 1959 Brookes scored 28,980\nfirst-class runs and 67 centuries in\n492 matches for Northamptonshire,\nreaching 1,000 runs in a season\n17 times and 2,000 on six\noccasions, all county records. The\nconsummate batting craftsman,\nhe gained high marks for artistic\nimpression as well as technical\nmerit; his former opening partner\nPeter Arnold reckons Brookes \"the\nmost graceful player you could\nfind anywhere\" while Frank Tyson\nrelished his old skipper's \"silky\ndrives and subtle deflections\". After\nthat initial setback against Verity\nhe attained grandmaster status\nwhen it came to handling spin and\nalways rated an innings of 102 out\nof 185 against Kent's Doug Wright\non a turning Northampton pitch in\n1952 as his best ever.",
        "He was understandably irked\nthat only one Test appearance\ncame his way. Though he never\nwent on about it - not at all the\nBrookes style - immediately after\nthe war RC Robertson-Glasgow had\npicked him out as one who had\n`the look of an England batsman,\nnot merely of a man who happens\n... to play for a team called\nEngland.' Twelfth man in the first\ntwo Tests against India in 1946,\nBrookes was measured (at Wally\nHammond's insistence) for a MCC\ntour blazer but was not chosen for\nAustralia. He went to West Indies\nwith Gubby Allen in 1947-48 and\nmade 108 against Barbados to\nsecure his place in the opening\nTest at Bridgetown, only to break\na finger in the field. His tour and\nhis England career were over.\nInterviewed on his 80th\nbirthday, Brookes revealed that\nFreddie Brown had sounded him\nout about going to India as senior\nprofessional in 1951-52 but again\nnothing came of it. It was a clear\ninjustice, according to Arnold:\n\"Admittedly it was the era of\nHutton and Washbrook but other\nopeners played for England who\nwere not as good as Dennis, not by\na long way.\"",
        "Born at Kippax near Leeds,\nBrookes claimed his first 35-\nshillings-a-week contract with\nNorthamptonshire owed much\nto the fact that he could type a\nbit and so help out in the office\nin winter. A first-team regular by\n1936, he secured his place in the\ncounty's folklore in 1939 by hitting\n187 against Leicestershire to set up\ntheir first Championship victory\nsince May 1935.",
        "Northamptonshire feared they\nmight lose him in 1945, when\nYorkshire sniffed around briefly,\nbut he stayed put and by 1954\nwas the club's first professional\ncaptain. Although the old\ndistinctions between gentleman\nand player were never less clearly\ndefined than in the person of\nDennis Brookes, some in the\ncommittee room still regretted\nthe absence of an amateur in\ncharge. After achieving second\nplace in the Championship in\n1957 he was eased out in favour of\nRaman Subba Row, who had been\npromised the captaincy for 1958\nbefore going into the RAF a couple\nof years earlier.",
