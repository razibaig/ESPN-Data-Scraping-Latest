        "\nDavid Capel was England's nearly man who had the definitive impossible job when he came into an England side looking for the new Ian Botham in the mid-1980s, and after swimming confidently for a time, he soon sank. Quite simply, Capel was not good enough to justify his place with bat or ball, and averages of 15 and 50 from 15 Tests tell the story. He made a 98, at Karachi in 1987-88 but he also had 13 scores of 6 or less in 25 innings. His energetic medium-pace was pretty innocuous but he did have a distinguished rabbit: Viv Richards, who he dismissed three times. And he did play his part in one of England's most unlikely successes, as the most sedate of Graham Gooch's four-man seam attack in Jamaica in 1989-90.   \n",
