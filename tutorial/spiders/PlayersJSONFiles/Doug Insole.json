        "\nDoug Insole was probably better known for his influence on cricket after the\nend of his playing days rather than his exploits on the field. He was\nhowever, a fine batsman, who made over 50 first-class hundreds and had a\nmodest Test career. His method was unorthodox, with an open\nstance, and a dominant bottom hand. This made him vulnerable to the ball\nmoving away from him, but an excellent eye, combined with great\nconcentration and tenacity, made him successful. He adapted his methods to\nthe state of the game, but his natural inclination was to score at a fast\nrate. \n",
        "An excellent slip fielder (he also occasionally kept wicket), Insole was also\nan outstanding leader. He honed his captaincy skills at Cambridge in 1949,\nand took over the leadership of Essex from T.N Pearce the following year.\nEssex finished bottom of the championship that summer, but over the next\ndecade became a force in the championship, in no small part due to Insole's\ninfluence. He understood the game well, and was popular with his players. He\nbowled occasional medium pace, and was good enough to take 138 first-class\nwickets.",
        "Insole's Test career consisted of nine matches spread over seven years.\nHe debuted against West Indies in 1950, but twice was dismissed cheaply by\nRamadhin as England were heavily defeated. Five years later he was given a\nsecond opportunity against South Africa, and played a single Test against\nAustralia in 1956, without notable success. He was chosen to vice-captain\nthe England tourists visiting South Africa in 1956, and topped the England\nTest batting averages. He made an important century in the third Test, and\nEngland won the series. He played for England just once more, making a duck\nin his final innings against South Africa in 1957. He continued to play for\nEssex until his retirement in 1963, having at that point made centuries\nagainst all the first-class counties, other than his own, with over 25,000\nfirst-class runs.",
