        "\nJoseph William Henry \"Harry\" Makepeace, who died at his home at Bebington, Cheshire, on December 19, aged 70, was one of the few men who played both cricket and Association football for England. Born at Middlesbrough, Yorkshire, on August 22, 1882, he was associated with Lancashire C.C.C. for forty-six years. His playing career with the country commenced in 1906 and he held a place in the side until 1930. Altogether he scored in first-class cricket 25,745 runs, average 36.15, including forty-three centuries, the highest of which was 203 against Worcestershire at Worcester in 1923. In the same summer he hit 200 not out from the Northamptonshire bowlers at Liverpool. Ten times he obtained more than 1,000 runs in a season, his best being in 1926 when his aggregate reached 2,340 and his average 48.75. An excellent cover-point and a batsman who, strong in defence, relied chiefly upon placing the ball and seldom put much power into his strokes, he carried his bat four times through a Lancashire innings. He shared in five partnerships of over 200 for the county, the largest of which was 270 for the first wicket with C. Hallows against Worcestershire at Worcester in 1922. In the match with Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in 1912 he and A. H. Hornby engaged in a century opening stand in each innings--141 and 196. As a member of J. W. H. T. Douglas's M.C.C. Team in Australia in 1920-21, he took part in four Test matches, and in the fourth, at Melbourne, he hit 117 and 54. \n",
